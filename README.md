🚖 OLA Ride Analysis – Booking Funnel, Cancellations & Revenue Leakage
📌 Business Problem

Despite strong booking demand, a large portion of ride requests fail due to cancellations and operational issues, leading to significant revenue leakage and reduced platform efficiency.

This project analyzes where bookings drop, why cancellations occur, and which operational issues should be prioritized to improve ride success and revenue realization.

🎯 Business Decisions This Analysis Supports

• Should interventions focus more on drivers or customers?

• Which vehicle types and time windows are operationally risky?

• What are the top cancellation drivers impacting revenue?

• Where should teams focus first to recover maximum lost revenue?

📊 Dataset Overview

• 103,000+ ride bookings

• Multiple vehicle types: Sedan, SUV, Auto, Bike, eBike, Mini, Prime

• Data includes:

  • Booking status & cancellation reasons

  • Revenue per booking

  • Vehicle type performance

  • Time-based patterns

  • Ratings (driver & customer)

🛠️ Tools & Skills Used

• MySQL

• SQL (aggregations, CASE logic, analytical queries)

• Power BI

  • Interactive dashboards
  
  • Filters & slicers
  
  • KPI cards
  
  • Funnel, trend, and distribution visuals
  
  • Business & operational analysis

📈 Dashboard Overview (Power BI)

The Power BI dashboard provides an end-to-end operational view of OLA ride performance:

🔹 Overall Performance

 • Total bookings: 103,024

 • Successful bookings: 63,967

 • Success rate: 62.09%

 • Total booking value: ₹35M

🔹 Vehicle Type Analysis

 • Revenue and success value by vehicle type

 • Distance travelled & average trip length

 • Identification of high-risk vehicle categories (eBike shows higher cancellation tendency)

🔹 Revenue Insights

 • Revenue split by payment method (Cash & UPI dominate)

 • Daily revenue trends across the selected date range

 • Top customers by booking value

🔹 Cancellation Analysis

 • Customer vs Driver cancellation breakdown

 • Top cancellation reasons:

 • Customers: driver not moving, driver asked to cancel, change of plans

 • Drivers: personal/car issues, customer-related issues

 • Time-based cancellation risk (peak around 10 AM, 10 PM, 7 AM)

🔹 Ratings Analysis

 • Driver and customer ratings by vehicle type

 •Ratings remain stable (~4.0), indicating cancellations are operational, not satisfaction-driven

🔍 Key Analytical Insights
1️⃣ Booking Funnel

 • Only 62.09% of bookings convert to completed rides
    ➡️ Nearly 38% leakage in the funnel

2️⃣ Cancellation Ownership

 • Drivers cancel more rides than customers
    ➡️ Supply-side reliability is the dominant issue

3️⃣ Revenue Leakage

 • Total revenue generated: ₹3.50 Cr

 • Revenue lost due to failed bookings: ₹2.14 Cr

4️⃣ Revenue Loss by Failure Type

 • Driver-related cancellations account for ~47.5% of total revenue loss (~₹10.18M)
    ➡️ Highest-impact area for intervention

🧠 Final Recommendation (What to Fix First)

Driver-related cancellations cause the highest revenue loss and should be prioritized first.
Improving driver availability, monitoring movement toward pickup, and incentivizing ride completion can recover more revenue than customer-side fixes.

🚀 Outcomes & Actions Enabled

 • Clear prioritization of operational issues

 • Data-backed focus on driver-side interventions

 • Identification of risky vehicle types and peak hours

 • Improved decision-making through interactive dashboards
